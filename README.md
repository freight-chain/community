# Pristine

Pristine is an open source repository in its original condition.

There are a lack of repositories to start from to build community driven open
source projects. Pristine is a starting point, it follows a Documentation Driven
Development approach, and can be used as a resource to augment existing
documentation.

## How to use Pristine in your project

There are 2 options for using pristine with your project.

1. Fork this repo as the start of your own, OR
2. [follow these instructions](https://thoughts.t37.net/merging-2-different-git-repositories-without-losing-your-history-de7a06bba804)
   to use it on an existing repository.

## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive open source development. Documenting the problem in
the README gives a middle ground between technical and non-technical
specifications. This allows organizing solutions to this challenge around
community and documentation.

> [...] a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near
> worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out
> how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.

### Conventions and Specifications

[Basic Changelog Convention (.hbs file)](https://github.com/freight-trust/releases/blob/master/changelog.hbs)

We use different `git commit` styles for different purposes namely: <br />

`angular`: primary style for codebase commits <br />

`ember`: primary style for infrastructure commits <br />

`atom`: primary style for docs, branding, non "programatic" repo's (i.e. for
branding, community repos, etc) <br />

[Find `.hbs` tooling specific for styles here](https://github.com/freight-trust/releases/tree/master/toolchain/packages)
